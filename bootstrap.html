            <h2>CyberPunk 2077</h2>
            <p>This is a game that I have been looking forward to for a very long time. Due to the covid its release has been pushed back and I am leaving for a job overseas in a 3rd world country and I may not be able to get it before I go. Hopefully I can. Fingers Crossed</p>

            <h2>Ark Survival Evolved</h2>
            <p>This is the game that I currently play the most. Its a ridiculously fun game and my buddies and I enjoy it a lot. Due to the new job though my time with it is coming to an end.</p>

            <h2>Escape from Tarkov</h2>        
            <p>Probably my favorite game of all time. Its well made and looks really good. The mechanics in the game are well designed as well. I think ill always have thing game downloaded just because its that fun.</p>
